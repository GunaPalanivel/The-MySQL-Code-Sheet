# Create a new MySQL User Account

To start working with MySQL, follow these steps:

- Next, you can create a new test user for practice. To do that, run the following command:

  Example:

  ```sql
  CREATE USER ‘username’@’localhost’ IDENTIFIED BY ‘password’;

  ```

- If you need to delete a user later on you, use this command:

  Example:

  ```sql
  DROP USER ‘someuser’@’localhost’;

  ```
